                    <h2>Info</h2>
                    <p class="highlight">Overview</p>
                    <p>Catsriel's Password Generator is a password generator designed to create secure passwords while remaining user-friendly.</p>
                    <p>The Generator is 100% clientside, and does not send or recieve any data, nor does it save anything.</p>
                    <p>The source code is available on Github if you want to double check for yourself.</p>
                    <p>This website is an updated version of an older project I did when I was first learning JavaScript.</p>
                    <p>This version of the website is an expanded version of that old project, with some more features that the old project did not have.</p>
                    
                    <p class="highlight paragraphSpace">Recommendations</p>
                    <p>This generator is specificially designed around a password manager, so it's recommended you use one to get the most use out of this website.</p>
                    <p>I personally recommend Bitwarden. It's free, and simple to use.</p>

                    <p class="highlight paragraphSpace">Limits and Suggestions</p>
                    <p>The Default generator has a maximum character limit of 100 characters.</p>
                    <p>Default length is 20 characters.</p>
                    <p>The Human-Readable generator has a maximum word limit of 6.</p>
                    <p>Default length is 2 words, but 3+ is recommended.</p>

                    <p class="highlight paragraphSpace">Explanations</p>
                    <p>This generator is a combination of a couple different generators.</p>
                    
                    <p class="highlight paragraphSpace">Secure Password Generator</p>
                    <p>A completely random password generator, including letters, numbers and special symbols. Password manager Recommended.</p>

                    <p class="highlight">Human-Readable Password Generator</p>
                    <p>A password that picks different words from a list alongside a 3 digits and a special character to memorize. </p>
                    <p>While the standard generator is recommended for most use cases, the Human-Readable generator is better for master-passwords and other passwords where you can't use a password manager.</p>

                    <h2>How to use</h2>
                    <p>This generator is not super complex to use, but here is a quick tutorial just incase.</p>

                    <p class="highlight paragraphSpace">Options</p>
                    <p>The Options menu is on the left side of the screen on widescreen devices, and on the top on mobile devices.</p>
                    <p>To change password length, set a number in either of the textboxes.</p>
                    <p>To change a setting, click the button next to a prompt. The setting is automatically updated. </p>

                    <p class="highlight paragraphSpace">Colours</p>
                    <p><span class="colorRed">Red</span> Button / False - Option is Disabled</p>
                    <p><span class="colorLime">Green</span> Button / True - Option is Enabled</p>
                    
                    <p class="highlight paragraphSpace">Generators</p>
                    <p>To switch between generators, click the first button underneath the "Human-Readable Passwords" Category.</p>
                    <p>The Standard-Generator is the default generator.</p>
                    <p>To generate a password, click the "Generate" button. To copy the current password to the clipboard, press "Copy to Clipboard".</p>
