# CatsrielsPasswordGenerator
A remake of an older project of mine.

This is a remake of my old "Bad Password Generator" Project that I made when i was first learning JavaScript.
(SOURCE CODE: https://github.com/twomuchCatsriel/badpasswordgen)

This project has support for Standard Random Passwords and "Human Readable Passwords", which is a password created by randomly combining words from a list, a 3 digit number and a special character.

This project is not finished, and I have more stuff that I want to add to this generator. This includes:
- Statistics about each Password (Statistics about Password Length, Special Characters, Capital Letters, Numbers etc)
- More options for Password Customization
- More words in the Human-Readable generator
- And alot more.
